# Ridge Regression applied to Housing dataset

## About the Project

The project aims at appliying ridge regression on the Californian housing dataset, where some of its features are highly correlated, suffering from multicollinearity. Ridge regression is a form of regression, which introduces a regularizer in the ERM to penalize the flexibility of the model and so to increase its stability, making it "stable" when training dataset is modified. Another biased regression technique limiting the multicollinearity problem is principal components regression, where principal components of the explanatory variables are used as regressors. Furthermore, cross validation estimate has been studied to choose the best parameter alpha of ridge regression.
